# Multiple Camera Shutter Sync Checker
 Arduino LED Counter determines multiple camera shutter synchronization.
 
 I take simultaneous photos of this 1 millisecond LED counter with twin cameras to determine how closely 
 the camera shutters trigger. The LEDs are mounted on a 12 inch plastic ruler, most significant bit on left.
